# Experiment_EaPU
The simulation code of EaPU. 

The code includes simulation experiments of the resnet with cifar10/cifar100, the swin transformer with mini-imagenet and the srresnet with ImageNet.

# Pretrained weight
The pretrained weight of the swin transformer is available at https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.0/swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth.

# Data download
